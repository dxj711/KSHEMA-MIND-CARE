            and behavioral problems such as acute stress, depression, anxiety,
            schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), eating
            disorder and behavioral problems often require special
            counseling and treatment in psychiatric facilities. It involves
            relatively short term or long term stays for stabilizing clients and
            then transferring them to outpatient treatment centers to lead a
            normal life. It has a comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment
            plan established for clients with psychiatric illness. Clients
            suffering from pervasive mental illness require medication
            therapy, counseling, housing; vocational assistance and activity

            clients to return to functional states within the community.
            An addiction is a dependency syndrome where you have a
            difficult situation to stop or controlling alcohol or substance
             abuse which is chronic but treatable brain disorder. Initially it is
            pleasurable but the continued usage becomes compulsive,
            destructive which interferes with ordinary life responsibilities
            such as work or relationships, even health. Users may not be
            aware that their behaviour is out of control and causing problems
            for themselves, family and society. This lack of control develops
            poor self esteem decreased tolerance, decreased efficiency, poor
            money handling, selfishness, carelessness, ethical breakdown,
            dishonesty, prolonged time in.

            Alcoholism and substance abuse are treated as a disease and
            promote abstinence for long lasting recovery. Alcohol is a drug
            too as when its abused like any other drug, the negative
            consequences will flare up in their work, studies and personal life
            or they may get legally punished by the law due to their abuse.
            A mental illness is a medical condition that disrupts a person
            thinking, feeling, mood, ability to relate to others and daily
            functioning. Serious mental illnesses to include major depression,
            schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder
            [OCD], panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and
            borderline personality disorder.

        <p>
            Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age, race, religion or
            income. Mental illnesses are not the result of personal weakness,
            lack of character or poor upbringing. Most people diagnosed with
            a serious mental illness can experience relief from their
            symptoms by actively participating in an individual treatment
            plan.
